# Day 6 Notes â€“ RBAC & Deletion

## âœ… What we did
- Added `_get_cognito_info_from_event` helper and **RBAC checks** across all Lambda functions:
  - **Presign Upload** â†’ allowed for `uploader`, `admin`.
  - **Presign Download** â†’ allowed for `viewer`, `uploader`, `admin`.
  - **List Files** â†’ allowed for all roles.
  - **Delete File** â†’ allowed for `admin` only.
  - **Record Download** â†’ allowed for `viewer`, `uploader`, `admin`.
- Updated `template.yaml` with necessary IAM policies for each Lambda.
- Created **Cognito groups** (`viewer`, `uploader`, `admin`).
- Created users for each group:
  - `vieweruser@example.com` â†’ can only list & download.
  - `uploaderuser@example.com` â†’ can list, upload, download.
  - `testuser@example.com` (admin) â†’ full rights including delete.
- Successfully tested:
  - Viewer user â†’ could list but upload/delete was denied.
  - Uploader user â†’ could upload and list, delete denied.
  - Admin user â†’ could delete, confirmed DynamoDB row + S3 object removed.

## ðŸ§ª Validation
- `apitest.ps1` used with each roleâ€™s IdToken.
- Verified RBAC rules enforced correctly.
- Confirmed file upload, download, listing, and deletion behaviors per role.

## ðŸ“Š Status
- Backend + RBAC = **100% complete** âœ…
- Remaining (Day 7):
  - Frontend (React/HTML) integration.
  - Documentation (security architecture + deployment guide).
  - Demo video.
